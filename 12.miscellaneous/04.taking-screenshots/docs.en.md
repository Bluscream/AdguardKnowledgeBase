## Introduction

Screenshot is a capture of your computer’s or mobile device’s screen, which can be obtained by using standard tools or a special program/app.

Sometimes a screenshot (or screenshots) is required by support team to better understand the problem, and not everyone knows how to take screenshots, especially of a separate window or a specific screen area on their devices. If you recognize yourself as one of these users, don’t worry. This article will help you as it describes a range of ways to take screenshots on different platforms.

### Android

Taking a screenshot on an Android device can be done in various ways — depending on the device model and its manufacturer.

Generally, you should use the following button combination for Android:

- **Hold down at once the _Volume Down_ and the _Power_ buttons for 1–2 seconds**

Your Android device will capture the entire screen and save it as a photo. So, you can find the screenshot in a Screenshots folder in your Gallery.

But, as it has been already said, there can be differences depending on a particular device. Let’s look at other possible combinations:

- **Hold down at once _Home_ and _Power_ for 1–2 seconds;**
- **Hold down at once the _Back_ and the _Home_ buttons**

On Android 8 and later there is also a possibility to take a screenshot by placing your hand vertically along the left or right edge of your phone and swiping in from that edge with your hand touching the screen.

If this method doesn’t work, check _Settings_ > _Advanced_ features to enable _Palm swipe to capture_.

Besides, you can always use any special applications for taking screenshots on your devices, for example — _Screenshot Easy_, _Screenshot Ultimate_, _Screenshot Snap_ etc.

### iOS

Any iOS device (barring ancient ones) lets you take a screenshot using standard tools.

To take a screenshot on an iOS device, use the following combination:

- **Press the _Sleep/Wake_ (side) button and the _Home_ button at the same time, then quickly release them**

and this one for iPhone X or later:

- **Press the _Sleep/Wake_ button and the _Volume up_ button at the same time, then quickly release them**

Your iOS device will capture the entire screen and save it as a photo. You can find it in a standard Photo app.

### Windows

- **To take a screenshot on Windows, press the _PrtScn_ button**

On some notebooks you have to hold _Fn_ and then press _PrtScn_ instead.

_Please note: PrtScn (Print Screen) button can be differently abbreviated on various keyboards — PrntScrn, PrtScn, PrtScr or PrtSc._

Windows captures the entire screen and copies it to the (invisible) clipboard.

To take a screenshot of an active window, use the following combination:

- **Hold down _Alt_ and press _PrtScn_ (or _Fn + Alt + PrtScn_ on some laptops)**

To take a screenshot of a specific area, you should use the following combination:

- **Hold down _Win_ (the Windows button) and _Shift_ and press _S_**

After you take a screenshot, it will be saved in the clipboard. In most cases you will be able to paste it into a document that you are currently editing by using _Ctrl + V_ button combination. Alternatively, if you need to save the screenshot into a file, you should open the standard **Paint** program (or any other app that can work with images). Paste your screenshot there using the same button combination or by clicking the Paste button (usually in the top left corner of the screen) and then save it.

Windows 8 and 10 let you take a screenshot very quickly with a _Win + PrtScn_ combination. As soon as you press these buttons, the screenshot will be automatically saved as a file to your Pictures -> Screenshots Folder.

There is also a dedicated program for taking screenshots called _Snipping Tool_ that you can find via Start menu among standard programs of your computer. Snipping Tool lets you capture of any area of your desktop or the entire screen. After taking a screenshot using this program you can edit the picture and save it to any folder on your computer.

Besides, you can also try using different apps for taking screenshots on your computer, like **PicPick**, **Nimbus Screenshot**, **Screenshot Captor**, **Snipaste**, **Monosnap** etc.

- **Press and hold together _⌘ Cmd + Shift + 4_**. Drag the crosshair to select the needed area. Release your mouse or trackpad to take a screenshot, press the Esc button to cancel it.

To take a screenshot of the _Touch Bar_ (MacBook Pro) use the following combination:

- **Hold down _⌘ Cmd + Shift + 6_**

Your Mac captures the entire _Touch Bar_ and saves it as a file on the desktop.

To copy a screenshot to the clipboard instead of saving it, hold down _Ctrl_ together with any of the combinations above. Then you can paste the screenshot (from the clipboard) into a document or an image you are currently editing by using _Cmd + V_ combination.

You can also take screenshots by using **Preview** and choosing **Take screenshot** (of the selected area, window, or the entire screen). With **Preview** you can save your screenshots in JPG, TIFF, PDF, and other file formats.
