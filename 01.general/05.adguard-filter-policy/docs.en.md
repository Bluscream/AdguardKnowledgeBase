When discussing AdGuard ad filters, there is often one topic that causes disputes – whether shall AdGuard block this or that ad. By framing the rules we stick to special criteria. Our criteria are much similar to [EasyList Policy](https://easylist.to/pages/policy.html), which we find correct and appropriate. Nevertheless, we've made some changes to it.

## Terminology

Throughout this text, we use terms **first party** and **third party**.

A first party is a website that a user is intentionally and knowingly visiting and the set of resources on the web operated by the same organization. In practice, we consider resources to belong to the same party if they are part of the same registrable domain: a public suffix plus one additional label. Example: `site.example`, `www.site.example`, and `s.u.b.site.example` are all the same party since `site.example` is their shared registrable domain.

A third party is any party that does not fall within the definition of first party above. Interactions with other parties are considered third-party, even if the user is transiently informed in context (for example, in the form of a redirect). Merely hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of content does not constitute an intention to interact.

## Common criteria

These equally apply to rules in all filters.

- Rules that often cause problems with work of some websites will be deleted.
- Rules that are specific to a particular website will be added only if the website has sufficient traffic. Traffic is determined by open statistics (if it has such) or in other ways, for example social media following. Website’s traffic is considered sufficient when it has 30 thousands visitors a month.

## Ad filters

This part describes AdGuard Base filter, Mobile ads filter and following language-specific filters: Russian, German, Dutch, Spanish/Portuguese, Japanese, Turkish, Chinese, French.

##### What shall these filters block?

## Quality requirements for filtering rules

- The rules should be as efficient as possible in terms of performance.
- Exception rules shall be as much specific as possible, in order to avoid unnecessary unblocking.
- CSS and JS injection rules shall be used as rarely as possible, and only in case when ad blocking is impossible without them.
